Magic, AI related improvements and some cool amazing (seriously, I think so) additions, which make the game nicer(Castle, Buttrefly, Fountains, Trees etc.).
ANCII and PyGame versions aren't supported yet, but Tkinter looks and works pretty nice.

To run you need to install PIL library!

You want to see that in action? My way is to run the code in IDE. That way you can remove some element, for example Trees, if they are irritating you. So don't forget about PIL and map.png, map2.png!
